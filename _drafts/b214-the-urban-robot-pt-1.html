<p>In recent years, the talks of robot roaming in cities, side by side with man have been loud.  It's close; it's coming in the next few years.  Yet, here in 2014, we still don't see any robot among us.  Why is that?  This Big Project will be aimed just to answer that question.  Why isn't there robot among us yet?</p>
<p>Now, the first thing to we need to understand is the progress of robot til this day.  There is two main school of approach in designing robots.  The first school we will discuss is the engineered, mathematical robots.  Now, these robots are designed by mathematicians and manufactured by engineers.  Prime example of these robots are Curiosity rover, and the common place assembly line arms.  These robots are simple in design and are designed aim to tackle a singular problem.  And these robots are actually pretty far into a practical stage.  They are widely used in factories and some even in house holds like the Roomba.  Now there are another school of approach that has quickly gained weight, that is Biomicmicry robotics.  These robots are often designed in model of an animal.  These series of robots mainly exist in the research stage:  Boston Dynamic's PETman, Professor Songbae Kim's robot Cheetah, and Harvard's robot fly.  As these robots are still mainly in research phase, most of them are designed to answer a research problem at hand.  Thus, they are not very practical, and often are still a few years from being use practically in everyday life.  But now you're thinking.  Well, we have one set of engineered practical robot ready to go, why don't we use that right now?</p>
