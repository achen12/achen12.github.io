<p>Welcome!</p>
<p>I'm Alex Chen.  Good in Theory is my personal project blog.  I will be posting my development journals and project related materials up here.</p>
<p>Remember the first project you ever tackled?  You were exploring your own uncharted territory, or just playing around with new ideas or gadgets. That pride and excitement of the very first project is the core of this blog.  I will post up both problems I will face and solutions I tried.  The blog will capture the moment where it all come together or the moment it critically failed.</p>
<p>So take a look around, and feel free to comment!</p>
