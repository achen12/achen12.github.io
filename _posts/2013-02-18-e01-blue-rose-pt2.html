<h4>Trial 4: Another way to dye</h4>The polka dot effect seems to be caused by the type of food dye I am using.&nbsp; Thus, in this trials, food coloring paste is used.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-fnOFX55d5TA/USL03EfUfhI/AAAAAAAAADo/-xGSWVLfnJk/s1600/2013-02-08_18-08-55_878.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-fnOFX55d5TA/USL03EfUfhI/AAAAAAAAADo/-xGSWVLfnJk/s320/2013-02-08_18-08-55_878.jpg" height="243" width="320" /></a></div><span id="goog_1115937819"></span><span id="goog_1115937820"></span>The effect of the food coloring paste seems to be very strong on the edges of the pedal, not so much on the face of the pedal. Though there are some vein like coloring in the base of the pedal, but not as much as the liquid food dye did.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-_872LbPza8o/USL0360t_7I/AAAAAAAAAEA/WMQK06oRrqc/s1600/2013-02-08_18-09-17_189.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-_872LbPza8o/USL0360t_7I/AAAAAAAAAEA/WMQK06oRrqc/s320/2013-02-08_18-09-17_189.jpg" height="240" width="320" /></a></div>This is just another trial of the liquid dye, just acting as a mean of control. Also note that I am actually getting different variety of rose in each trial.Though it is not a good thing to have this floating variable affecting the trials, the effect shouldn't differ that much.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Also in this trial, I have tried to cut the stem of the rose more regularly, the life span of the rose and the speed of the dye doesn't seem to have changed. Also the type of cut, previously a vertical cut splitting the stem, now a common diagonal cut, does not have any significant effect on the speed or effect of the dye.<br /><br /><h4>Trial 5: Success!</h4>It seems that though the two dye should be working under the same principle, it is producing a diverse effect. This might be caused by the difference of the molecular structure and size of the pigments. So what is the result?<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-RLPt836Cc-o/USL5UpwbvAI/AAAAAAAAAFY/cJTLNXeZVsU/s1600/PHOTO_20130216_124647.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-RLPt836Cc-o/USL5UpwbvAI/AAAAAAAAAFY/cJTLNXeZVsU/s320/PHOTO_20130216_124647.jpg" height="179" width="320" /></a></div><br />Success! It is the closest thing to a blue rose. The edges are emphasized by the food paste and the pedal are filled by small amount of liquid food dye. For this one, I just added the standard 10 drop for ~200ml of water, and less than half a tea spoon of food paste. Also I have tried a another batch of 3 in parallel with increased concentration ~ 200%. Sadly, the roses couldn't handle the high concentration and withered quite quickly. So this concluded the blue rose experiment for now... I might get back to this some time in the future, but seeing that I ran out of dye and also very happy with the result. This experiment is successfully closed! Here are some more photos of them.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-VZfPR3jmVSA/USL5STuZzYI/AAAAAAAAAEo/uF-wrN-X_4s/s1600/PHOTO_20130216_124329.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-VZfPR3jmVSA/USL5STuZzYI/AAAAAAAAAEo/uF-wrN-X_4s/s320/PHOTO_20130216_124329.jpg" height="178" width="320" /></a></div><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-73ulssybU_U/USL5SdXQb0I/AAAAAAAAAEg/RKj_J2CiDjY/s1600/PHOTO_20130216_124313.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><br /></a></div><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-LYHalJXGXv8/USL5VfttnxI/AAAAAAAAAFs/p5mKcfCcioY/s1600/PHOTO_20130216_124920.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-LYHalJXGXv8/USL5VfttnxI/AAAAAAAAAFs/p5mKcfCcioY/s400/PHOTO_20130216_124920.jpg" height="400" width="223" /></a></div>
