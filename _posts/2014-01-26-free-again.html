<p>Sorry about the delay,  I was messing around with the configures in scripts and lost the dashboard...  Little that I know the script wordpress had connected to my actual   word press account.  It somehow passed the control over to the other account...  But I finally got it back!  So everything is good again.  Awesome!</p>
<p>So about this blog.  I will list various projects I have done and currently doing.</p>
<p>To start, I will show you a quick project.</p>
<p>Project :Recycling Glass<br />
Code: C01<br />
Objective &amp; Need:  On a college campus, glass bottle are readily available.  What can we do with these empty bottles?</p>
<p>Research:  One of the most plausible craft project is to purpose them for a drinking glass.  There are many tutorial on this.  The main steps are performing a plane cut on the bottle, and optionally joining the two pieces in another configuration.  The tutorials have reach a consensus on how to easily perform such cut.<br />
A lighter fuel drenched string is loosely tied to the bottle.  It is then lit and heats the bottle for a few minutes.  Lastly to cut the bottle, the bottle is rapidly cooled with a water source.  The real question is where to cut.  There are two different cut:  One between the shoulder (Top curvature) and the body (Straight cylinder), and one on the heel (the Bottom).   Here are some product picture which showcases the two cuts:<br />
The shoulder cut:  www.collegeenvy.com/2013/04/16/turn-your-beer-bottles-into-glass-cups-5-easy-steps/#.UuRS_rROmM8<br />
The bottom cut:  http://www.envirogadget.com/home-gadgets/beer-bottle-goblets-drinking-vessels-made-from-old-beer-bottles/</p>
<p>Concept:  Now, I really like the bottom cut in that it uses the whole glass.  But would you use a goblet on a daily basis?  The shoulder cuts would make a better daily glass.  So  how could we combine the two?  Actually why bother combining?  Just cut the bottle into two and split it into two glasses!  So we will be separating a glass bottle into a daily drinking glass and a fancy glass.  See Figure A.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://alexc89.scripts.mit.edu/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/2014-01-12-18.40.39.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-23 aligncenter" alt="2014-01-12 18.40.39" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2014-01-12-18.40.39-1024x617.jpg" width="614" height="370" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Fig 1. Shoulder Cut (Fully Recycled)</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The cut was quite tricky.  The heat usually overpowered.  A single loop would often time work.  The cooling thermal shock is the tricky bit.  The water source doesn't need to be cooled, but instead running.  My friend and I was testing the cut and was puzzled by why didn't the glass break when we dip it into an ice cold bowl of water.  On the seventh attempt on a mexi-cola bottle, we decided to just place the heated glass under a running tap,  and it worked instantly  and more importantly repeatedly.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Here is my friend, Herbert, holding a finished product from a sprite bottle.<br />
<a href="http://alexc89.scripts.mit.edu/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/2014-01-12-17.06.27.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-22 aligncenter" alt="2014-01-12 17.06.27" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2014-01-12-17.06.27-617x1024.jpg" width="370" height="614" /></a></p>
<p>The cuts were quick rough, especially at the knot of the string.  We realize that the roughness was from excessive heating, and adjusted the heating time accordingly.<br />
Unfortunately, I couldn't find any cheap glass discs as described in the plan.  But luckily I improvised with a candle holder and made it into a goblet, which turned out better than originally planned.  Here are products from large Orangina bottle with a quarter for scale.</p>

<p>I have been using the two glasses frequency for the past few weeks and it was a lot of fun.  The project build time was pretty quick, but it might be quite hard to make the glasses on a gift-able level.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Post Research:<br />
Later I realized that there are improved method of cutting using hot water kindly provided by Mr. Rojas at GreenPowerScience: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFXngPx3w3M.  I haven't tried it yet, but it seems awesome.  The only problem it might have is cutting a thick bottle like mexi-cola bottle.</p>
<p>I hope you liked it and more will be coming!</p>
