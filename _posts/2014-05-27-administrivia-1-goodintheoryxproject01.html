It seems that I have abandoned Good in Theory for too long.&nbsp; So I proudly declare that one of my summer projects will be merging Good in Theory with my current resume blog "Project 1".<br /><br />Both Good in Theory and Project01 will the same amount of content in term of individual project count.&nbsp; Also both will be using the new ProjectID system in Project01 to label the individual projects.&nbsp; The difference between the two blog however will be the approach the narrative will be written.<br /><br />Good in Theory will be a project journal.&nbsp; A step by step journal on how the project is going.&nbsp; Since a lot of the material is pre-recorded on a lab journal, I will be re-writing them back into Good in Theory.<br /><br />Project01 will be a project report.&nbsp; Essentially a summary of the background and results of each project.&nbsp; It will be quick and focus down onto what was achieved in each project and/or what is learned through the project.<br /><br />So I hope that I will be have time to make sure that the two blogs are merged beautifully.&nbsp; Expect posts to be back up in a week or two.
