<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-uKbP4VxOZ0s/U43cB3Hkx1I/AAAAAAAAAXk/jemP6j0RO1g/s1600/RobotTemp.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><br /></a></div>In the last episode....&nbsp; Team 3 has to solve The Grand Challenge.&nbsp; Their robot will land on Mars (Model Mars... i.e. a  Maze) with cubes (living quarter modules) landed all around the maze.&nbsp; Their objective is to have the robot collect the modules and build a small  structure with the cubes before the astronauts landed (in 10 minutes).&nbsp; Now....  How could they make the RSS robot in 4 weeks to do that?....<br /><br />We.... Didn't...&nbsp; Or other words,&nbsp; we build a whole another robot to solve the problem.&nbsp; Now, why is that?&nbsp; This is mainly because of the short 4 week period.&nbsp; This is a critical point.&nbsp; Most of the members including me are robot competition veterans.&nbsp; We understand that with only 4 weeks and with only a single run for the final competition, we need to think low tech.&nbsp; Now, in a typical robot design, we can typically split the robot into two levels: high and low.&nbsp; Low level portion of the robot include the basic mechanical design, sensors, and simple control loops.&nbsp; High level includes sensory analytics(Mapping) and decision making (Path Planning).&nbsp; To increase the robustness of the robot, we focused down on the low level designs.&nbsp; And this is what we came up with...<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-uKbP4VxOZ0s/U43cB3Hkx1I/AAAAAAAAAXo/_ZwhM4qKCY4/s1600/RobotTemp.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-uKbP4VxOZ0s/U43cB3Hkx1I/AAAAAAAAAXo/_ZwhM4qKCY4/s1600/RobotTemp.png" height="150" width="320" /></a></div>Unlike the RSS bot, the new robot will not use an arm to pick up the cubes with its arm, but just roll the cube up with a ramp and funnel it to a wall hopper on the back.&nbsp; You might be thinking... This is a very poor CAD.... And yes, it is.&nbsp; Here's the actual CAD.<br /><br />[Insert CAD pic]<br /><br />So as you can see, we have solidified a lot of things.&nbsp; There's a kinect camera mounted inverted on the top of the robot.&nbsp; We have chosen to use the kinect, because we can mark identified cubes very easily and reliably.&nbsp; Also the robot increased in height to house more layers of cubes in the back hopper.&nbsp; So what does it actually look like when built?<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-L65SXOIkfZA/U43gNtaRgDI/AAAAAAAAAYU/i_YlWnPtT6c/s1600/2014-05-07+16.11.12.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-L65SXOIkfZA/U43gNtaRgDI/AAAAAAAAAYU/i_YlWnPtT6c/s1600/2014-05-07+16.11.12.jpg" height="240" width="320" /></a></div><div style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;<i>Front</i></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-AOL0HtoYqHc/U43gM0q__5I/AAAAAAAAAYI/IBTmlGcd3Nw/s1600/2014-05-07+16.11.04.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-AOL0HtoYqHc/U43gM0q__5I/AAAAAAAAAYI/IBTmlGcd3Nw/s1600/2014-05-07+16.11.04.jpg" height="240" width="320" /></a></div><div style="text-align: center;"><i>Side</i></div>As you can see, there are a lot of changes between the CAD and the actual robot.&nbsp; First the sonar wall sensors are placed higher to avoid detecting the cubes by mistake.&nbsp; There are two computers on board.&nbsp; First the Mac tucked away in the lower deck to process the Kinect data and scout for the road ahead.&nbsp; It'll then report to the netbook upstairs via ROS (Robot Operating System).&nbsp; The netbook then talk with the microcontrollers to actuate the whole robot.&nbsp; Thirdly, there is an added rubber band in the middle to be used as a front bump sensor.&nbsp; It will trigger a toggle switch placed on the left and tell the brain that it hit something in front.&nbsp; In the 4 weeks, we focused down on every low level designs we can use to avoid using any of the complex high level items.<br /><br />In the software side, we made some overhaul from the RSS robot, too.&nbsp; In hope of increasing our connectivity speed, we migrated our code base from ROS Electric to the newest (at the time) ROS Hydro.&nbsp; We essentially abandoned our code in the RSS bot and re-programed everything ourselves.&nbsp; Thankfully, because of the modularity that the ROS system provide us, we can easily divide up the tasks by specifying the inter module messages before hand.&nbsp; We were doing it so well in fact.&nbsp; In the 48 hour time window between our first ungraded trial run and the actual run, we abandoned all of our code again and restarted.&nbsp; Because of the modular frame work, the five of us can code relatively fast on a small code base (~10^3 lines).<br /><br />Here is our robot in action along with the whole team presenting.<br />(Team order from left to right:&nbsp; me, Clark, Will, Ami, and Eric)<br /><div style="text-align: center;"><br /><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="270" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/8h85KQ9W8Ns" width="480"></iframe></div><br />In the end of the video, our robot played the 1984 overture to welcome the astronauts.&nbsp; Just as the round is over, it lifts up its hopper and release the wall. &nbsp; Unfortunately, the wall is covered by the map structure in this angle.&nbsp; We're hoping to get a footage with a better angle. <br /><br />In the end, we were the only team that ever gotten more than 10 cubes during any of the runs, and the only team that have constructed a 4+ structure (7 cubes!).<br /><br />
