Various small tasks, the brain of Curiosity will be able to handle it relative to the current environment.<br /><br /><br />Wait.... So if Autonomous robots are so great, why don't we just use automonous robots all the time?&nbsp; Autonomous robots are extremely costly to develop, and a lot of problems that might be simple for you are extremely difficult for a robot.&nbsp; For example, how would you crack an egg?&nbsp; When you're cracking an egg... Do you think of which edge in the kitchen to strike the egg with?&nbsp; How about what approach vector should the egg enter to enable the crack?&nbsp; How about the force?&nbsp; Or even the magnitude of each of your muscle fiber of your body to allow the egg to approach in that velocity and that force to the edge of the bowl? Small actions like that, which you do all naturally without thinking, needs to be planned and executed correctly for a robot.<br /><br />So in course, five other undergraduates and I will team up, build, and implement the most awesome robot! Pt.2 will be on the first half of the course, building the standard robot.&nbsp; And Pt.3 will be on our robot and how it overcome the challenges.<br /><br />
