So welcome to another portion of the blog. In this P series, I'll be making cool projects!<br /><br />Mirage is a naturally occurring&nbsp;phenomenon&nbsp;that creates an optical illusion that displaces objects at a distance. &nbsp;One of the more commonly known effect of the phenomenon is to cause objects to appear closer to the viewer. &nbsp;The project - mirage, is similar.<br /><br /><b>Origin:</b><br />The project is something I thought up the night before a hackathon. Talking about hackathons....<br /><br />Hackathons are more and more common. &nbsp;If you like a night or weekend spent coding a cool and innovative demo to be presented to others like you, &nbsp;you will love Hackathons, because it is exactly what it is about! Usually people attend these events in a team, but you can also form teams on the spot. I prefer the latter, because the people who attend are fantastic and interesting people. It is definitely worth the first few minutes of&nbsp;awkwardness&nbsp;to meet these cool people!<br />So who do you contact to attend these hackathons?? Search up colleges near you! Sometimes clubs or student organizations will host hackathons for fellow students and coders to attend! But what if you are not near any colleges that host hackathon?? Look up companies and makerspace! Sometimes the big corps will host awesome hackathons that have traveling cost covered! Makerspace usually hosts hackathon or similar events on a weekly if not monthly basis!<br /><br />So I didn't know anything about that the night before <a href="http://techfair.mit.edu/events/hackathon/" target="_blank">hackMIT</a>. Just realized that I actually need to come up with a project for the hackathon, a rough concept of an easily&nbsp;customizable remote for your computer.<br /><br /><b>HACKATHON!</b><br />Have you ever needed a remote for your presentation? Ever needed a custom keyboard pad to execute a small script on your computer? Mirage can turn your phone into just that. &nbsp;It allows 5 customizable scripts that can be triggered by a button from your phone. Whether it is call a quick git commit&amp;push, or a tweet of "<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPZW8_ID-l4" target="_blank">I'm Batman</a>", Mirage will tell your computer to execute the desired script through SSL Socket talk.<br /><br />This is the first time I have touched Android Dev, Socket, and Hackathon. So just so that I don't screw anyone over, (Hackathons have cool prizes too!), I went on alone.<br />Fortunately, I was able to gotten through the basic features of executing scripts and forwarding script from your phone to the computer. Of course, being the first timer on everything that was done, I was so <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFlcqWQVVuU" target="_blank">happy</a>!<br />But the app was completely unsecure, so I wouldn't recommend any of you to use it. But it comes down to presentation time. After presenting the first round and seeing everyone's presentation, I was amazed by other people's project and physically tired from the event. So I returned home early before the finalist round proud of my first time @ a hackathon. Little to my knowledge, I was actually selected as one of the finalist! <br /><br />And here is another tip for hackathon, believe in yourself! When you think you cannot do it, keep pushing! You can do it! When you think your project sucks, be proud of yourself and your own work!<br /><br />So it was fun! It was great! And you should join in on the fun!<br /><br />
