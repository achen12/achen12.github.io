So these are the kind of experiment that the blog will gear toward to. So What are Piezo Crystals? They are crystal that exhibit piezo-electric effect, turning physical stress into electric potential/energy and vice versa. These little magical things are mainly used in contact mic, buttons, and more and more electronics that require mechanical feedback, as we understand more of the piezo effect.<br /><br />So what is the challenge in this experiment? This time, we'll be growing our own piezo crystal, specifically Rochelle Salt (Potassium Sodium Tartrate). This neat little crystal was the first to be discovered with piezo-electric effect. And don't worry, Rochelle Salt is an approved food additive(E337), though I would not recommend directly drinking or ingesting any of the material or product we will make up.<br /><br />How do we do it? We'll use cream of tartar(Potassium Bitartrate), soda ash dye fixers (Sodium Carbonate), and water (H2O).<br /><br />So simply dissolve a bottle(~100 g) of cream of tartar into 125 ml of water. Heat it up slightly to help the process. Lastly slowing adding Soda Ash in increments until the solution clears up. This is a sudden and very noticeable process as the sizzling quickly diminishes. Similar to this process that I referenced to (http://www.seawhy.com/xlroch.html), but reduced the material by 50% and also skipped the process of producing Soda Ash from Baking Soda.<br /><br /><br />A good reference tutorial video is <a href="http://blog.makezine.com/2011/03/11/collins-lab-homebrew-piezo/">this</a>. It is done by Collin @ MAKE.<br /><br /><h4>Trial 1&amp;2:&nbsp; Apple Cider</h4>Material/Setup:<br /><br /><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-PdYlB2L4oqA/USMQqrdqf2I/AAAAAAAAAGg/WkEGQ5cqLC8/s1600/PHOTO_20130218_150806.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-PdYlB2L4oqA/USMQqrdqf2I/AAAAAAAAAGg/WkEGQ5cqLC8/s320/PHOTO_20130218_150806.jpg" height="179" width="320" /></a>As stated before, the amount of cream of tartar is roughly 100g, which is about two small bottle or one standard spice bottle(shown below). There is a chance that the cream of tartar is made out of a cheaper substitute. So currently the tartar tried is the McCormick Cream of Tartar and also the Spice Island Cream of Tartar.<br /><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-pPXudurH2dM/USMRAhs_7hI/AAAAAAAAAG4/OKAPMcW911M/s1600/2013-02-10_16-45-50_760.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-pPXudurH2dM/USMRAhs_7hI/AAAAAAAAAG4/OKAPMcW911M/s320/2013-02-10_16-45-50_760.jpg" height="239" width="320" /></a></div><br />I mixed in the 100g of cream of tartar into 125 ml of water. The resultant is a milkly homogeneous solution<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Ilo-a0G2oeo/USMQx-BtaRI/AAAAAAAAAGo/59ekRXivZ30/s1600/2013-02-10_16-46-24_447.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Ilo-a0G2oeo/USMQx-BtaRI/AAAAAAAAAGo/59ekRXivZ30/s320/2013-02-10_16-46-24_447.jpg" height="239" width="320" /></a><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-P0G_wF2fvOg/UShJ7DA7KuI/AAAAAAAAAHI/SJ7LdJ9xCMI/s1600/PHOTO_20130218_160010.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-P0G_wF2fvOg/UShJ7DA7KuI/AAAAAAAAAHI/SJ7LdJ9xCMI/s320/PHOTO_20130218_160010.jpg" height="179" width="320" /></a>As a safety precaution, though everything is water soluble and food safe, I place a 500ml beaker to contain any splash, which will occur when soda ash is added. After adding the soda in small increments and some sizzling, as Collin's video has shown, the solution loses its precipitates and turn clear.<br /><br />Yet instead of a clear solution, the solution was slight brown, like apple cider. So after washing down everything carefully, I checked the web and noticed that other people are also coming across this problem. The major cause seems to be that the cream of tartar is made of a cheaper substitute. But my bet is that something is in my slightly murky tap water that is affecting the experiment. So next time, with distilled water and another brand of cream of tartar!<br /><br />And also more chemistry related explanations hopefully!<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
