<p>To quickly explain the category system and the Project ID System.</p>
<p>So!   The projects will be separated by three main divisions.</p>
<p>First, Academic:  These are projects that are completed or started base on a school assignment.  Of course, I will not simply complete the assignment, but pushing it to the limit.  You will see what I mean when I post an example project.</p>
<p>Then we move on to the projects that I do on the side.  The more series half, Big:  Unfortunately, I couldn't find a good enough name for this.  I will be improving the name on a future time, but these will be major robotic projects and/or major related project.  These could also be spinoffs from completed assignments.</p>
<p>Lastly, fun!  This is most likely the most important category, because the best projects spawn from interesting, intriguing, and essentially fun ideas!  In this, there will also be quick 1 hr projects.  Just like the first one I have posted: F01.</p>
<p>For now, the numbers are in serial, but in the future, I hope they will be randomized.  Why?  Because the projects posted are not necessarily in chronological order or in any logical order at all.  And it is cooler that way.  That's all for now.  See you next time!</p>
