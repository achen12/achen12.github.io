Sup!<br /><br />Sorry for the delay. I'm planning on updating every Saturday afternoon.<br /><br />So for the next update:<br />The First Project feature: Mirage (android app).<br />This is a project which I did in a hackathon.<br />I'll explain why every coder should go to hackathons and what exact they are.<br /><br />Also I ordered some beaker for the piezo crystals. Probably a good idea to separate chemistry stuff with cooking wares.... So yeah, hopefully they will arrive soon, and we'll be cooking ourselves some crystals! (the federal search spiders will have fun with this.) And on a side note, please if you want to do something like this, notify your&nbsp;neighbors&nbsp;and don't do it in a sketchy environment.<br /><br />Cheers,<br />AC
