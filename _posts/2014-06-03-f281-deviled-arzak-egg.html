<p>Time: May 2014<br />
Objective (s):  Make a deviled egg without the need to de-shell.</p>
<p>Background:  Have you ever made deviled egg?  The most time consuming part of making this fantastic little treat is de-shelling the hard-boiled egg.  A deviled egg in essence, is a hard boiled egg with its egg yolk removed and replaced by a glorious mixture of an egg salad.  These little things are one of the coolest egg dishes you can make at home.  But how could it be done?</p>
<p>Method:  Recently (in culinary time scale at least), new techniques has been discovered using modern tools from plastic foils to high pressure cookers.  Some of these amazing discoveries are made by a extraordinary chef that needs no introduction - Chef<i> Juan Mari Arzak.</i>  A particular egg dish that he created (and owes its namesake to him) is the Arzak Egg.  Instead of poaching an egg while it is intact.  Chef... Or Master Arzak crack the egg and placed the egg yolk and white into a small bag made of plastic foil.  He then strings the little bag and placed in simmering water.  With this technique, not only can you cook a poached egg easily, but you can actually see what is going on while it is poaching!!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Inspired by this, I wanted to use this technique to create a deviled egg version of Arzak Egg.  I will use a secondary feature of Arzak Egg which is it's ability to repackage the egg.  Because we are going to cook the egg in what is essentially a plastic bag, thus the egg will take shape of the bag.  We first cooked the egg yolk separately and create the deviled egg yolk mixture.  Then, we place the mixture and some egg white in the bag and poach it in simmering water.   And viola!  Deviled Arzak Egg!</p>

<p>Result: Now there were some problem with the design, which I have or need to improve.  Now, the down side of this process is that the egg yolk mixture will be heated during the cooking process.  Thus the component ratio in the yolk mixture has to be adjusted.  To avoid the yolk mixture from over cooking I've increased the portion of the mayo.  Also because I will be adding salt and pepper on the exterior to garnish, I removed the salt and pepper in the mixture, but increased the content of the mustard to increase flavor.  One major part that I am still struggle with is on the exterior of the egg.  Because the plastic bag isn't as smooth as the egg shell, the cooled egg often look rough.  Perhaps I can replace the plastic bag with another material next time around.</p>
<p>Now there are some interesting properties I noticed after the fact.  Because I'm relying on the Arzak Egg's ability to repackage the egg, I can actually adjust the portion.  i.e. Instead of the traditional recipe which can only make 1 deviled egg out of a single chicken egg,  I can adaptively change the size of the finished product into 1 Jumbo Deviled Egg: 2 chicken egg or 2 Mini Deviled Egg: 1 chicken egg.  Also this method doesn't just stay with Deviled Egg alone.  By using this method, both the egg yolk and the egg white can be modified prior of the egg taking shape.  It would be interesting to experiment in some sweetened desert egg that is created in this fashion.  Or even a complete egg meal made from various versions of modified Arzak Egg.</p>
<p>Yea!  Thanks to Rachel, the dish is displayed on the MIT admission blog!  <a href="http://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/a-faculty-dinner">Link</a></p>
