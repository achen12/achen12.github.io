In many cultures, the blue rose symbolizes the unattainable love, status, and fortune. It is a mythical object that grants happiness for those who finds it. Well, for the first experiment, we will be trying to create that perfect rose.<br /><br /><br />This was an ongoing experiment as the blog is created so we're going to cut immediately to trial 2. Not that trial 1 failed miserably..........&nbsp; lol.<br /><br />How? Blue rose is mainly artificially created through dye, or floral spray paint. However, there are company that are genetically modifying roses to secrete blue pigments themselves. In our case, because floral spray paint would be too anti-climatic, we will be trying out dyeing white roses blue.<br /><br />Now, usually professional florist would have a professional dye to dye a large quantity of blue roses, but as small hobbists we probably wouldn't want to do so.<br /><br /><br /><h3><b>So Trial 1&nbsp; Food coloring?</b></h3>Method:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First I trim the rose as short as possible for the vase I have in hand. Then I split the stem from the bottom roughly 1.5~2 inches up.<br /><br />So Trial 1 is a complete failure, the dye proportion is completely off. So I have increased the ratio to<b> </b>roughly 20 droplet of dye to ~290ml of water for trial 2.<br /><br /><br /><br /><h3><b>Trial 2 Increased Dye.</b></h3><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-j1O8bz7NruY/UQxc-VzMUOI/AAAAAAAAACg/j0ynauPnPk4/s1600/2013-01-12_07-39-24_143.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-j1O8bz7NruY/UQxc-VzMUOI/AAAAAAAAACg/j0ynauPnPk4/s320/2013-01-12_07-39-24_143.jpg" height="238" title="" width="320" /></a>Sadly, the florist I went did not have white roses at the moment, but instead pale yellow roses..... Hey, a good time to test out if the food color might mingle with the natural pigments! So Blue, in you go.<br />So I inserted the dye roughly 2PM, and this is 7AM of the next day. Not so bad! The left contains trial for 15 drops/ 290 ml. The other: 20 drops. It seems slightly green, but let the dye continue to work its magic.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Q96HIpcYfdA/UQxdGt4HEtI/AAAAAAAAACo/eWwCCjxLEfM/s1600/2013-01-13_12-34-46_539.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Q96HIpcYfdA/UQxdGt4HEtI/AAAAAAAAACo/eWwCCjxLEfM/s320/2013-01-13_12-34-46_539.jpg" height="238" width="320" /></a></div><br />This is the rose again @ noon the third day. The dyeing process have slowed down dramatically after the first day. The blue dye pigment seems to be gathering into polka dots instead of an uniform shade. And you might notice on the background, the small white decorative flower have also absorbed the dye and become polka-dotted.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />So what now? We seems to got the dye ratio right, but the type of dye might not be able to create a nice shade. Also the natural pigment doesn't seems to interact with the dye if the natural pigment is too weak. Similar result can be done when the dye gain enough time to overcome the natural pigment.<br /><br />Let give it another try for the white roses!<br /><br /><br /><h3><b><span style="font-weight: normal;"><b>Trial 3:&nbsp; Back in White</b></span></b></h3>So this time I got half a dozen white roses. 2 for Blue, 2 for Purple (mixed Red and Blue dye to see if the dyes would mix well in the process), and 2 for mixed. Now the last pair is suppose to create a rose with two separate color of pedal in a single rose. This is achieved by dipping the split ends into two separate dye.<br /><br />Setup:<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Z9G3-zEuMAw/UQxj7pLZRRI/AAAAAAAAAC4/X7uZrode5nI/s1600/2013-01-29_18-50-52_85.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Z9G3-zEuMAw/UQxj7pLZRRI/AAAAAAAAAC4/X7uZrode5nI/s400/2013-01-29_18-50-52_85.jpg" height="297" width="400" /></a></div><div style="text-align: center;">From the left: Hybrid,&nbsp; Purple, Blue.<br /><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-z2FRkBoJ1_k/UQxj_pf6_7I/AAAAAAAAADA/6aDFYJIsWS0/s1600/2013-01-30_08-08-31_841.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-z2FRkBoJ1_k/UQxj_pf6_7I/AAAAAAAAADA/6aDFYJIsWS0/s320/2013-01-30_08-08-31_841.jpg" height="238" width="320" /></a></div>Similar to Trial 2, the edge very quickly turned to the desired color. This time, the process is a lot faster... Why? Because this time, the flowers were not water in the florist shop upon arrival. So these little guys were soaking up water, as soon as the dye hit the stem. As you can see, the polka dot has already begin. This picture is on the second day morning. Dye started shortly after dusk ~7pm.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-mueahYUNOzM/UQxkFAvfVyI/AAAAAAAAADI/TbzgpG9AwdA/s1600/2013-01-30_08-08-56_922.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-mueahYUNOzM/UQxkFAvfVyI/AAAAAAAAADI/TbzgpG9AwdA/s320/2013-01-30_08-08-56_922.jpg" height="238" width="320" /></a></div>This is the purple. Not as vivid as the blue, but doing quite well. It seems that the red is either not as concentrated as the blue, or that not as easily soaked up as blue.<br /><br />I awaited for the third day... &nbsp;The polka dot appeared. The color seems to be going darker and dark to blue.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-fNsJuNfHeOM/UQxmag5pFSI/AAAAAAAAADY/fSzUwKCTOwU/s1600/2013-01-30_08-09-08_370.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-fNsJuNfHeOM/UQxmag5pFSI/AAAAAAAAADY/fSzUwKCTOwU/s320/2013-01-30_08-09-08_370.jpg" height="238" width="320" /></a></div>The Hybrid consist of orange on the left and purple on the right. As you can see, the orange are slowly crawling into the pedals, but the purple not so well. The trouble that this method is that I didn't have any container that has a thin separator for the two dye, &nbsp;so the stem has to be split 2~3.5 inches from the base just so that the two separate stems and contact both dyes.<br /><br />They were just like this on the Thursday. Kinda dead, too.<br /><br /><br /><br />So what to do next time?? &nbsp;A different dye, also refresh the cut every other hours, try the dye without splitting. And another attempt at Hybrid. Coming soon, Trial 4 of the Blue Rose.<br /><br />Also coming up.... Pieh what? Experiments in Piezo Crystals.<br />Also coming up.... The first Project.
