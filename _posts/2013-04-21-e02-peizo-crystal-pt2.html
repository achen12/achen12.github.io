Taiwanese Apple Sidra is one of the best soda I have ever tasted. If you like the famous Brazilian <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guaran%C3%A1_Antarctica" target="_blank">Guarana Antarctica</a> or any fruity soda, Apple Sidra is one you wouldn't want to miss.<br /><br />Any how. Even More Apple Cider!!!!<br /><br />I'm not going to waste your time in seeing more boxes with yellowish liquid in them.<br /><br /><b>Trial 3:</b> Variable changed: Water has been switched to distilled to remove any possible minerals that is affecting the reaction.<br /><br /><b>Trial 4:</b> Variable changed: cream of tartar is switch to a more deluxe version from SpiceIsland ( same company in trial 1).<br /><br /><b>Trial 5:</b> Variable changed: cream of tartar is switched to a third brand.<br /><br />Invariant from all trials:<br /><br /><ul><li>Soda Ash: The dye fixer was purchased from an Artistian shop. Perhaps the dye fixer includes other&nbsp;ingredients&nbsp;that improves its function as a dye fixer. Alternative would be producing chemistry grade soda ash by reducing baking soda.</li><li>Method: During the process, the sizzling is allowed to finish, before the next spoon of Soda Ash is added. &nbsp;Perhaps that allowed the process to step into another product. &nbsp;I will have to study more on how exactly the process would go wrong.</li></ul><div>So there is many things to do. &nbsp;Go Go Go!</div><br /><br /><br />
