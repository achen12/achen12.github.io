<p>It's 2014!</p>
<p>This is my first post!  I'm Alex Chen, and welcome to my blog.<br />
Though I have been playing around the idea of blogging and tested a few blogs myself,  it is about time that I should start a real blog. My aim for this blog is to showcase my projects and also opening them up for criticisms and suggestions.  Hopefully, one day I can attached it to my resume and use it as a portfolio, but that's looking too far down the road.  There will at least be a weekly post, but we'll see.  Anyhow,  Happy New Years!</p>
