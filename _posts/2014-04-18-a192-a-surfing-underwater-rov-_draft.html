<p>Hello!  Welcome to my first Academic post.</p>
<p>Class:  2.007us  Manufacturing I-  Underwater Section<br />
Time: Feb-May 2013<br />
Objective (s):  Build an underwater Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV)<br />
Build another ROV related project with with a team.</p>
<p><a href="http://alexc89.scripts.mit.edu/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/KIC-Document.pdf">Journal - 2.007us</a></p>
<p>Background:  The course have been doing small robot games for a few years now.  Just the year before, they were experimenting with a new section called 2.007 Go Kart, which instead of a small servo robot, the students will build a GoKart or a powered vehicle.  To continue this effort, 2.007 team opened up a new 2.007us (underwater section) in my year.  Unlike the normal 2.007 course, there will be two projects for the new section:  one as an individual project, and a second as a team project.  The professor in charge is Ed Moriarty, a great teacher at MIT Edgerton Center.  He believe that the 2.007 need to include an element of teamwork, because for most engineering tasks, it require a team of engineers with unique skills.  And so he splits the semester into two parts.  Thus for this particular project, the span only last for half a semester.<br />
For ROV, these are vehicles that serve a very unique purpose.  In the 1970s and 80s, they were used by navy to recover practice mines and torpedo that are still at risk of detonating.  The ROV not only allows the operator to stay away from the extreme hazards, but also allow ROVs to carry extreme loads and perform super human like tasks.  Usually ROVs are a square box with motors and robotic arms attached, just like the Hercules ROV shown below.  But there could also be other form factors to tailor to different tasks, such as the HiRobot's ACM-R5H.  It is also shown below in my breathe research note on the topic.</p>

<p>Origin:  <del>Professor Moriarty</del> Ed [writer's side note:  Not quite sure why Ed doesn't prefer the awesome name of Professor Moriarty, but that wouldn't stop me from trying to change that.] challenged us to redesign the concept of ROV.  At the time, I did not have any clue as to what to do.  But as soon as he talked about a water gliding ROV as an idea, I immediately know what I am going to build...</p>
<p><strong> A Hydro Foil ROV</strong></p>
<p>A quick overview on what a hydro foil is.  A hydro foil is an extended fin that is submerged, either partially or completely.  As the vessel travel forward, the fin will generate lift and push the vessel above water.  The purpose of this is to lift the vessel's body off the water and thus reduce vessel drag.</p>
<p>A ROV are usually designed for stationary tasks, as in it is designed to travel to a specific location and stay there while it is conducting its tasks.  This resulted in a near cubic shape such as the Hercules ROV above.  The benefit of a hydrofoil on such ROV is the ability of traveling quickly to sites or location.  This setup could also be used in long range Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV), to travel quickly to sites and dive down to site.</p>
