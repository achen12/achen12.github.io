<p>Sorry that I couldn't get my narrative straight in Project01.  I really want to fully describe each project but also keeping it short for those who are viewing this via my resume.  So I've decided to complete this by merging Project01 with my old blog Good in Theory.</p>
<p>Both Good in Theory and Project01 will the same amount of content in term of individual project count. Also both will be using the new ProjectID system in Project01 to label the individual projects. The difference between the two blog however will be the approach the narrative will be written.</p>
<p>Good in Theory will be a project journal. A step by step journal on how the project is going. Since a lot of the material is pre-recorded on a lab journal, I will be re-writing them back into Good in Theory.</p>
<p>Project01 will be a project report. Essentially a summary of the background and results of each project. It will be quick and focus down onto what was achieved in each project and/or what is learned through the project.</p>
<p>So I hope that I will be have time to make sure that the two blogs are merged beautifully. Expect posts to be back up in a week or two.</p>
